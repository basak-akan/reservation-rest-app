# CodeChallenge Application

This application is designed to demonstrate a implementation for a RESTful API that manages reservations for a restaurant using Spring Boot for serverside services.
It includes functionalities for managing user data and reservations through RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete users.
- **Reservation Management**: Manage reservations with features to add, view, update, and cancel reservations.
- **Search Capability**: Filter users and reservations based on specific criteria.

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications that you can easily run.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and reservation data.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application and its environment.
- **JUnit**: For conducting integration and unit tests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 21
- Docker
- Gradle (optional, as you can use the embedded Gradle wrapper)

### Installation
